I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with your recent request for the original copies of the documents I provided for my claim, [Claim Number]. As you know, I submitted all the required documents in high-quality scanned formats on [Date of Submission].

I am deeply concerned about your request for the originals. Firstly, my policy clearly states that scanned copies are acceptable for claim submission. Demanding the originals is not only an unnecessary inconvenience but also violates the terms of my policy.

Secondly, the risk of losing the original documents is unacceptable. These documents are irreplaceable and essential for various legal and personal purposes. There is no guarantee that they will be returned to me in a timely or safe manner.

Therefore, I refuse to send the original documents. My scanned copies are clear, complete, and contain all the information you require to assess my claim. I urge you to process my claim based on the existing documentation without further delay.

I expect a prompt and professional response to this matter. Please confirm that you will proceed with my claim based on the scanned documents and provide me with a revised timeline for its settlement.
