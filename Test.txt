Subject: Urgent Complaint - Document Request for Claim # [Your Claim Number]
Dear Rahul,

I am writing to express my strong dissatisfaction with the recent request for original documents regarding my claim # [Your Claim Number]. I find this request both unreasonable and concerning for the following reasons:

No prior mention of originals: Throughout the claim process, no one mentioned the need for original documents. I submitted all required documents in clear, scanned formats on [Date of submission], as per the instructions provided. Asking for originals now creates unnecessary inconvenience and raises questions about the initial communication.
Risk of loss: The documents requested are crucial for my medical records and future hospitalizations. I cannot risk losing them by sending them to you, especially without any guarantee of their safe and timely return.
Policy compliance: My policy clearly states that scanned copies are acceptable for claim submissions. Demanding originals contradicts the terms of my policy and is an unfair practice.
Therefore, I urge you to reconsider this request and:

Process my claim based on the existing scanned documents. These are complete and provide all the necessary information for claim evaluation.
Provide a clear explanation for why originals are suddenly required. This transparency is essential for building trust and addressing my concerns.
Offer a secure alternative to submitting originals, if absolutely necessary. Perhaps certified copies or digital verification could be considered.
I have consistently followed instructions and diligently fulfilled my responsibilities throughout the claim process. This sudden demand for originals is not only unexpected but also puts me in a difficult and risky position.

I expect a prompt and satisfactory response to this matter within [Number] business days. If I do not receive a positive resolution, I will be forced to escalate this issue to [Regulatory body or ombudsman] and explore other legal options.

Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
