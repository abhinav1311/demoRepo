Who Provides Reference Data to FINRA?
Primarily, it's the financial institutions themselves that provide reference data to FINRA.

Here's a breakdown:

Market Participants: Broker-dealers, banks, and other financial institutions that trade TBA securities are the primary sources of reference data. They submit trade data, security details, and other relevant information to FINRA.   
Data Vendors: While not the direct source, companies like Bloomberg, Reuters, and S&P Global collect and aggregate data from various sources, including market participants and other data providers. They often provide this data to FINRA for validation and enrichment.
Regulatory Bodies: FINRA itself may collect data from other regulatory bodies or government agencies to supplement the information it receives from market participants.
The Role of FINRA
FINRA's role is to:

Standardize: Ensure that the data received from various sources adheres to a common format and structure.
Validate: Verify the accuracy and completeness of the data.
Disseminate: Distribute the processed reference data to market participants through platforms like TRACE.
Maintain: Regularly update and maintain the reference data to reflect market changes.
By centralizing and standardizing reference data, FINRA promotes market transparency, efficiency, and regulatory compliance.

So banks who generate loans give ref data ?

Banks and Reference Data for TBA
Not directly. Banks that originate loans are typically not the ones providing reference data to FINRA for TBA securities.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

Loan Origination: Banks create the underlying mortgage loans.
Securitization: These loans are bundled into mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
Issuance: The MBS are issued to investors, often as TBA securities.
Trading: The TBA securities are traded in the secondary market.
Reference Data: The entities involved in the secondary market (broker-dealers, trading platforms, etc.) are the primary sources of reference data for FINRA.
However, the information about the original loans (loan amount, interest rate, property type, etc.) is crucial for creating the reference data. This information is embedded within the securitized MBS, which is then used to generate the reference data for the TBA.

To summarize: While banks don't directly provide reference data to FINRA, the data they generate about the underlying loans is essential for creating the reference data used in the secondary market.
